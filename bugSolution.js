The solution involves careful dependency management and troubleshooting.  The specific steps vary depending on the exact error message.  Here are some general approaches:

1. **Clean and Rebuild:** Start by cleaning the project cache using `expo prebuild --clean` followed by a fresh build `expo build:android`.
2. **Update Dependencies:** Run `expo upgrade` to update your Expo and related packages. Then update other packages in your `package.json` file using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
3. **Identify and Resolve Conflicts:** Examine the error log meticulously.  It often points to libraries causing conflicts. Review the versions of those libraries, and try updating them or finding compatible versions.
4. **Use `npm-check-updates`:** Install and run `npm-check-updates` to compare your dependency versions to their latest available versions.  This helps in identifying outdated libraries that might be causing issues.  Use `ncu -u` to upgrade the specified packages. 
5. **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:** To help pinpoint the problem effectively, create a minimal project that reproduces the error. This isolates the issue and simplifies debugging.
6. **Check for Duplicate Packages:** Review the installed packages for any duplicates, especially those with conflicting versions.
7. **Search for Similar Issues:** Search online forums and issue trackers (like GitHub) for similar error messages to see if there are documented solutions or workarounds.

Remember to always commit your changes to version control before making significant changes to your project dependencies.
