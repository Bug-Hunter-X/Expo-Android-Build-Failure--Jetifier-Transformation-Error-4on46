# Expo Android Build Failure: Jetifier Transformation Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android apps using Expo CLI: the `jetifier` transformation failing during the build process.  The `jetifier` tool is used to convert libraries that use AndroidX to be compatible with older projects.

This issue often stems from dependency conflicts, where incompatible versions of libraries interfere with the transformation process.  The error messages can be ambiguous, making diagnosis challenging.

The `bug.js` file represents a simplified example of a project exhibiting this problem.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates solutions to identify and resolve such conflicts.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Examine the Full Error Log:** Carefully review the complete error log generated during the Expo build process. Look for specific errors mentioning libraries or dependency versions.
2. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning the project cache and rebuilding.  Use `expo prebuild --clean` followed by `expo build:android`.
3. **Update Dependencies:** Check your `package.json` and ensure all libraries are up-to-date. Use `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
4. **Dependency Resolution:** Identify conflicting dependencies.  Tools like `npm-check-updates` can help compare library versions.
5. **AndroidX Migration:** Verify your project is properly configured to use AndroidX.  If you encounter issues with older libraries, consider upgrading them or using compatibility packages.
6. **Check for Duplicates:** Ensure you don't have duplicate packages with differing versions installed.
7. **Reduce Dependencies:** Experiment by temporarily removing or commenting out non-essential libraries to identify possible culprits.
