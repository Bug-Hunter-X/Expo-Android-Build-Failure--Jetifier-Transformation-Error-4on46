This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves the `jetifier` transformation failing during the build process.  The error message might mention issues with specific libraries or point to problems with the Android Gradle Plugin.  It can be tricky to pinpoint the exact cause as it often points to a dependency conflict but doesn't directly identify which one.  The error may manifest as a cryptic error message within the build log or simply a build failure.
